    Aim: How do factors such as space, time, climate and other ecological
    drivers influence food web structure and dynamics? Collections of
    well‐studied food webs and replicate food webs from the same system that
    span biogeographical and ecological gradients now enable detailed,
    quantitative investigation of such questions and help integrate food web
    ecology and macroecology. Here, we integrate macroecology and food web
    ecology by focusing on how ecogeographical rules [the latitudinal diversity
    gradient (LDG), Bergmann's rule, the island rule and Rapoport's rule] are
    associated with the architecture of food webs.

    The difficulty of experimentally quantifying non-trophic species
    interactions has long troubled ecologists. Increasingly, a new application
    of the classic “checkerboard distribution” approach is used to infer
    interactions by examining the pairwise frequency at which species are found
    to spatially co-occur. However, the link between spatial associations, as
    estimated from observational co-occurrence, and species interactions has not
    been tested. Here we used nine common statistical methods to estimate
    associations from surveys of rocky intertidal communities in the Northeast
    Pacific Ocean. We compared those inferred associations with a new data set
    of experimentally determined net and direct species interactions. Although
    association methods generated networks with aggregate structure similar to
    previously published interaction networks, each method detected a different
    set of species associations from the same data set. Moreover, although
    association methods generally performed better than a random model,
    associations rarely matched empirical net or direct species interactions,
    with high rates of false positives and true positives, and many false
    negatives. Our findings cast doubt on studies that equate species
    co-occurrences to species interactions and highlight a persistent,
    unanswered question: how do we interpret spatial patterns in communities? We
    suggest future research directions to unify the observational and
    experimental study of species interactions, and discuss the need for
    community standards and best practices in association analysis.

    The longstanding biotic interactions hypothesis predicts that herbivore
    pressure declines with latitude, but the evidence is mixed. To address gaps
    in previous studies, we measured herbivory and defence in the same system,
    quantiﬁed defence with bioassays, and considered effects of leaf age. We
    quantiﬁed herbivory and defence of young and mature leaves along a
    continental gradient in eastern North America in the native herb Phytolacca
    americana L. Herbivory in the ﬁeld declined with latitude and was strongly
    correlated with lepidopteran abundance. Laboratory bioassays revealed that
    leaf palatability was positively correlated with latitude of origin. Young
    leaves were more damaged than mature leaves at lower latitudes in the ﬁeld,
    but less palatable in bioassays. Both defence and palatability displayed
    non-linear latitudinal patterns, suggesting potential mechanisms based on
    biological or climatic thresholds. In sum, observational and experimental
    studies ﬁnd patterns consistent with high herbivore pressure and stronger
    plant defences at lower latitudes.

    Although abiotic factors, together with dispersal and biotic interactions,
    are often suggested to explain the distribution of species and their
    abundances, species distribution models usually focus on abiotic factors
    only. We propose an integrative framework linking ecological theory,
    empirical data and statistical models to understand the distribution of
    species and their abundances together with the underlying community assembly
    dynamics. We illustrate our approach with 21 plant species in the French
    Alps. We show that a spatially nested modelling framework signiﬁcantly
    improves the modelÕs performance and that the spatial variations of species
    presence–absence and abundances are predominantly explained by different
    factors. We also show that incorporating abiotic, dispersal and biotic
    factors into the same model bring new insights to our understanding of
    community assembly. This approach, at the crossroads between community
    ecology and biogeography, is a promising avenue for a better understanding
    of species co-existence and biodiversity distribution.

    Aim Concerns over how global change will inﬂuence species distributions, in
    conjunction with increased emphasis on understanding niche dynamics in
    evolutionary and community contexts, highlight the growing need for robust
    methods to quantify niche differences between or within taxa. We propose a
    statistical framework to describe and compare environmental niches from
    occurrence and spatial environmental data.

    The brms package allows R users to easily specify a wide range of Bayesian
    single-level and multilevel models which are ﬁt with the probabilistic
    programming language Stan behind the scenes. Several response distributions
    are supported, of which all parameters (e.g., location, scale, and shape)
    can be predicted. Non-linear relationships may be speciﬁed using non-linear
    predictor terms or semi-parametric approaches such as splines or Gaussian
    processes. Multivariate models can be ﬁt as well. To make all of these
    modeling options possible in a multilevel framework, brms provides an
    intuitive and powerful formula syntax, which extends the well known formula
    syntax of lme4. The purpose of the present paper is to introduce this syntax
    in detail and to demonstrate its usefulness with four examples, each showing
    relevant aspects of the syntax.

    The brms package implements Bayesian multilevel models in R using the
    probabilistic programming language Stan. A wide range of distributions and
    link functions are supported, allowing users to ﬁt – among others – linear,
    robust linear, binomial, Poisson, survival, ordinal, zero-inﬂated, hurdle,
    and even non-linear models all in a multilevel context. Further modeling
    options include autocorrelation of the response variable, user deﬁned
    covariance structures, censored data, as well as meta-analytic standard
    errors. Prior speciﬁcations are ﬂexible and explicitly encourage users to
    apply prior distributions that actually reﬂect their beliefs. In addition,
    model ﬁt can easily be assessed and compared with the Watanabe-Akaike
    information criterion and leave-one-out cross-validation.

    Whether species interactions are static or change over time has
    wide-reaching ecological and evolutionary consequences. However, species
    interaction networks are typically constructed from temporally aggregated
    interaction data, thereby implicitly assuming that interactions are ﬁxed.
    This approach has advanced our understanding of communities, but it obscures
    the timescale at which interactions form (or dissolve) and the drivers and
    consequences of such dynamics. We address this knowledge gap by quantifying
    the within-season turnover of plant–pollinator interactions from weekly
    censuses across 3 years in a subalpine ecosystem. Week-to-week turnover of
    interactions (1) was high, (2) followed a consistent seasonal progression in
    all years of study and (3) was dominated by interaction rewiring (the
    reassembly of interactions among species). Simulation models revealed that
    species’ phenologies and relative abundances constrained both total
    interaction turnover and rewiring. Our ﬁndings reveal the diversity of
    species interactions that may be missed when the temporal dynamics of
    networks are ignored.

    Stan is a probabilistic programming language for specifying statistical
    models. A Stan program imperatively deﬁnes a log probability function over
    parameters conditioned on speciﬁed data and constants. As of version 2.14.0,
    Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through
    Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive
    form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood
    estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited
    memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm.

    Background
                . The number of individuals of each species in a given location forms the basis for many sub-fields of ecology and evolution. Data on individuals, including which species, and where they're found can be used for a large number of research questions. Global Biodiversity Information Facility (hereafter, GBIF) is the largest of these. Programmatic clients for GBIF would make research dealing with GBIF data much easier and more reproducible.
              
              
                Methods
                . We have developed clients to access GBIF data for each of the R, Python, and Ruby programming languages: rgbif, pygbif, gbifrb.
              
              
                Results
                . For all clients we describe their design and utility, and demonstrate some use cases.
              
              
                Discussion
                . Programmatic access to GBIF will facilitate more open and reproducible science - the three GBIF clients described herein are a significant contribution towards this goal.

    Many different concepts have been used to describe species’ roles in food
    webs (i.e., the ways in which species participate in their communities as
    consumers and resources). As each concept focuses on a different aspect of
    food-web structure, it can be diﬃcult to relate these concepts to each other
    and to other aspects of ecology. Here we use the Eltonian niche as an
    overarching framework, within which we summarize several commonly-used role
    concepts (degree, trophic level, motif roles, and centrality). We focus
    mainly on the topological versions of these concepts but, where dynamical
    versions of a role concept exist, we acknowledge these as well. Our aim is
    to highlight areas of overlap and ambiguity between different role concepts
    and to describe how these roles can be used to group species according to
    different strategies (i.e., equivalence and functional roles). The existence
    of “gray areas” between role concepts make it essential for authors to
    carefully consider both which role concept(s) are most appropriate for the
    analyses they wish to conduct and what aspect of species’ niches (if any)
    they wish to address. The ecological meaning of differences between species’
    roles can change dramatically depending on which role concept(s) are used.

  abstract: >-
    The perceived threat of climate change is often evaluated from species
    distribution models that are fitted to many species independently and then
    added together. This approach ignores the fact that species are jointly
    distributed and limit one another. Species respond to the same underlying
    climatic variables, and the abundance of any one species can be constrained
    by competition; a large increase in one is inevitably linked to declines of
    others. Omitting this basic relationship explains why responses modeled
    independently do not agree with the species richness or basal areas of
    actual forests.

    Aim: Recent studies increasingly use statistical methods to infer biotic
    interactions from cooccurrence information at a large spatial scale.
    However, disentangling biotic interactions from other factors that can
    affect cooccurrence patterns at the macroscale is a major challenge.

    Multivariate analyses are well known and widely used to identify and
    understand structures of ecological communities. The ade4 package for the R
    statistical environment proposes a great number of multivariate methods. Its
    implementation follows the tradition of the French school of ”Analyse des
    Donn´ees” and is based on the use of the duality diagram. We present the
    theory of the duality diagram and discuss its implementation in ade4.
    Classes and main functions are presented. An example is given to illustrate
    the ade4 philosophy.

    Functional ecology aims at determining the relationships between species
    traits and environmental variables in order to better understand biological
    processes in ecosystems. From a methodological point of view, this
    biological objective calls for a method linking three data matrix tables: a
    table L with abundance or presence–absence values for species at a series of
    sites, a table R with variables describing the environmental conditions of
    the sites, and a table Q containing traits (e.g., morphological or
    behavioral attributes) of the species. Ten years ago, the fourth-corner
    method was proposed to measure and test the relationships between species
    traits and environmental variables using tables R, L, and Q simultaneously.
    In practice, this method is rarely used. The major reasons for this lack of
    interest are the restriction of the original method and program to
    presence–absence data in L and to the analysis of a single trait and a
    single environmental variable at a time. Moreover, ecologists often have
    problems in choosing a permutation model among the four originally proposed.
    In this paper, we revisit the fourth-corner method and propose improvements
    to the original approach. First, we present an extension to measure the link
    between species traits and environmental variables when the ecological
    community is described by abundance data. A new multivariate fourth-corner
    statistic is also proposed. Then, using numerical simulations, we discuss
    and evaluate the existing testing procedures. A new two-step testing
    procedure is presented. We hope that these elements will help ecologists use
    the best possible methodology to analyze this type of ecological problem.

    Species distribution models (SDMs) are numerical tools that combine
    observations of species occurrence or abundance with environmental
    estimates. They are used to gain ecological and evolutionary insights and to
    predict distributions across landscapes, sometimes requiring extrapolation
    in space and time. SDMs are now widely used across terrestrial, freshwater,
    and marine realms. Differences in methods between disciplines reﬂect both
    differences in species mobility and in “established use.” Model realism and
    robustness is inﬂuenced by selection of relevant predictors and modeling
    method, consideration of scale, how the interplay between environmental and
    geographic factors is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current
    linkages between SDM practice and ecological theory are often weak,
    hindering progress. Remaining challenges include: improvement of methods for
    modeling presence-only data and for model selection and evaluation;
    accounting for biotic interactions; and assessing model uncertainty.

    We discuss the Gaussian graphical model (GGM; an undirected network of
    partial correlation coefficients) and detail its utility as an exploratory
    data analysis tool. The GGM shows which variables predict one-another,
    allows for sparse modeling of covariance structures, and may highlight
    potential causal relationships between observed variables. We describe the
    utility in three kinds of psychological data sets: data sets in which
    consecutive cases are assumed independent (e.g., cross-sectional data),
    temporally ordered data sets (e.g., n = 1 time series), and a mixture of the
    2 (e.g., n > 1 time series). In timeseries analysis, the GGM can be used to
    model the residual structure of a vector-autoregression analysis (VAR), also
    termed graphical VAR. Two network models can then be obtained: a temporal
    network and a contemporaneous network. When analyzing data from multiple
    subjects, a GGM can also be formed on the covariance structure of stationary
    means—the between-subjects network. We discuss the interpretation of these
    models and propose estimation methods to obtain these networks, which we
    implement in the R packages graphicalVAR and mlVAR. The methods are
    showcased in two empirical examples, and simulation studies on these methods
    are included in the supplementary materials.

    We created a new dataset of spatially interpolated monthly climate data for
    global land areas at a very high spatial resolution (approximately 1 km2).
    We included monthly temperature (minimum, maximum and average),
    precipitation, solar radiation, vapour pressure and wind speed, aggregated
    across a target temporal range of 1970–2000, using data from between 9000
    and 60 000 weather stations. Weather station data were interpolated using
    thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the
    coast and three satellite-derived covariates: maximum and minimum land
    surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the MODIS
    satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size
    depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy
    for temperature variables 5–15% (0.07–0.17 ∘C), particularly for areas with
    a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such
    regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates
    were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance
    varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model
    formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by
    selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global
    cross-validation correlations were ≥ 0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86
    for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed. The fact that most of our climate
    surface estimates were only marginally improved by use of satellite
    covariates highlights the importance having a dense, high-quality network of
    climate station data.

    Biogeography has traditionally focused on the spatial distribution and
    abundance of species. Both are driven by the way species interact with one
    another, but also by the way these interactions vary across time and space.
    Here, we call for an integrated approach, adopting the view that community
    structure is best represented as a network of ecological interactions, and
    show how it translates to biogeography questions. We propose that the
    ecological niche should encompass the effect of the environment on species
    distribution (the Grinnellian dimension of the niche) and on the ecological
    interactions among them (the Eltonian dimension). Starting from this
    concept, we develop a quantitative theory to explain turnover of
    interactions in space and time i.e. a novel approach to interaction
    distribution modelling. We apply this framework to host parasite
    interactions across Europe and find that two aspects of the environment
    (temperature and precipitation) exert a strong imprint on species
    co-occurrence, but not on species interactions. Even where species co-occur,
    interaction proves to be stochastic rather than deterministic, adding to
    variation in realized network structure. We also find that a large majority
    of host-parasite pairs are never found together, thus precluding any
    inferences regarding their probability to interact. This first attempt to
    explain variation of network structure at large spatial scales opens new
    perspectives at the interface of species distribution modelling and
    community ecology.

    We propose a multivariate approach to the study of geographic species
    distribution which does not require absence data. Building on Hutchinson’s
    concept of the ecological niche, this factor analysis compares, in the
    multidimensional space of ecological variables, the distribution of the
    localities where the focal species was observed to a reference set
    describing the whole study area. The ﬁrst factor extracted maximizes the
    marginality of the focal species, deﬁned as the ecological distance between
    the species optimum and the mean habitat within the reference area. The
    other factors maximize the specialization of this focal species, deﬁned as
    the ratio of the ecological variance in mean habitat to that observed for
    the focal species. Eigenvectors and eigenvalues are readily interpreted and
    can be used to build habitat-suitability maps. This approach is recommended
    in situations where absence data are not available (many data banks),
    unreliable (most cryptic or rare species), or meaningless (invaders). We
    provide an illustration and validation of the method for the alpine ibex, a
    species reintroduced in Switzerland which presumably has not yet recolonized
    its entire range.

    Plant–pollinator interactions are essential for the functioning of
    terrestrial ecosystems, but are increasingly affected by global change. The
    risks to such mutualistic interactions from increasing temperature and more
    frequent extreme climatic events such as drought or advanced snow melt are
    assumed to depend on network specialization, species richness, local climate
    and associated parameters such as the amplitude of extreme events. Even
    though elevational gradients provide valuable model systems for climate
    change and are accompanied by changes in species richness, responses of
    plant–pollinator networks to climatic extreme events under different
    environmental and biotic conditions are currently unknown. Here, we show
    that elevational climatic gradients, species richness and experimentally
    simulated extreme events interactively change the structure of mutualistic
    networks in alpine grasslands. We found that the degree of specialization in
    plant–pollinator networks (H20) decreased with elevation. Nonetheless,
    network specialization increased after advanced snow melt at high
    elevations, whereas changes in network specialization after drought were
    most pronounced at sites with low species richness. Thus, changes in network
    specialization after extreme climatic events depended on climatic context
    and were buffered by high species richness. In our experiment, only
    generalized plant–pollinator networks changed in their degree of
    specialization after climatic extreme events. This indicates that contrary
    to our assumptions, network generalization may not always foster stability
    of mutualistic interaction networks.

    That evolutionary history can influence the way that species interact is a
    basic tenet of evolutionary ecology. However, when the role of evolution in
    determining ecological interactions is investigated, focus typically centers
    on just one side of the interaction. A cophylogenetic signal, the congruence
    of evolutionary history across both sides of an ecological interaction,
    extends these previous explorations and provides a more complete picture of
    how evolutionary patterns influence the way species interact. To date,
    cophylogenetic signal has most typically been studied in interactions that
    occur between fine taxonomic clades that show high intimacy. In this study,
    we took an alternative approach and made an exhaustive assessment of
    cophylogeny in pollination interactions. To do so, we assessed the strength
    of cophylogenetic signal at four distinct scales of pollination interaction:
    (1) across plant–pollinator associations globally, (2) in local pollination
    communities, (3) within the modular structure of those communities, and (4)
    in individual modules. We did so using a globally distributed dataset
    comprised of 54 pollination networks, over 4000 species, and over 12,000
    interactions. Within these data, we detected cophylogenetic signal at all
    four scales. Cophylogenetic signal was found at the level of
    plant–pollinator interactions on a global scale and in the majority of
    pollination communities. At the scale defined by the modular structure
    within those communities, however, we observed a much weaker cophylogenetic
    signal. Cophylogenetic signal was detectable in a significant proportion of
    individual modules and most typically when withinmodule phylogenetic
    diversity was low. In sum, the detection of cophylogenetic signal in
    pollination interactions across scales provides a new dimension to the story
    of how past evolution shapes extant pollinator–angiosperm interactions.

    Species extinctions pose serious threats to the functioning of ecological
    communities worldwide. We used two qualitative and quantitative pollination
    networks to simulate extinction patterns following three removal scenarios:
    random removal and systematic removal of the strongest and weakest
    interactors. We accounted for pollinator behaviour by including potential
    links into temporal snapshots (12 consecutive 2-week networks) to reﬂect
    mutualistsÕ ability to ÔswitchÕ interaction partners (re-wiring).
    Qualitative data suggested a linear or slower than linear secondary
    extinction while quantitative data showed sigmoidal decline of plant
    interaction strength upon removal of the strongest interactor. Temporal
    snapshots indicated greater stability of re-wired networks over static
    systems. Tolerance of generalized networks to species extinctions was high
    in the random removal scenario, with an increase in network stability if
    species formed new interactions. Anthropogenic disturbance, however, that
    promote the extinction of the strongest interactors might induce a sudden
    collapse of pollination networks.

    There is much concern that the functioning of ecosystems will be affected by
    human-induced changes in biodiversity, of which land-use change is the most
    important driver. However, changes in biodiversity may be only one of many
    pathways through which land use alters ecosystem functioning, and its
    importance relative to other pathways remains unclear. In particular,
    although biodiversity–ecosystem function research has focused primarily on
    grasslands, the increases in agricultural inputs (e.g., fertilization,
    irrigation) and grazing pressure that drive change in grasslands worldwide
    have been largely ignored. Here we show that long-term (27-year)
    manipulations of soil resource availability and sheep grazing intensity
    caused marked, consistent shifts in grassland plant functional composition
    and diversity, with cascading (i.e., causal chains of ) direct, indirect,
    and interactive effects on multiple ecosystem functions. Resource
    availability exerted dominant control over aboveground net primary
    production (ANPP), both directly and indirectly via shifts in plant
    functional composition. Importantly, the effects of plant functional
    diversity and grazing intensity on ANPP shifted from negative to positive as
    agricultural inputs increased, providing strong evidence that soil resource
    availability modulates the impacts of plant diversity and herbivory on
    primary production. These changes in turn altered litter decomposition and,
    ultimately, soil carbon sequestration, highlighting the relevance of ANPP as
    a key integrator of ecosystem functioning. Our study reveals how human
    alterations of bottom-up (resources) and top-down (herbivory) forces
    together interact to control the functioning of grazing systems, the most
    extensive land use on Earth.

    Food webs typically quantify interactions between species, whereas evolution
    operates through the success of alleles within populations of a single
    species. To bridge this gap, we quantify genotypic interaction networks
    among individuals of a single specialized parasitoid species and its
    obligate to cyclically parthenogenetic aphid host along a climatic gradient.
    As a case study for the kinds of questions genotype food webs could be used
    to answer, we show that genetically similar parasitoids became more likely
    to attack genetically similar hosts in warmer sites (i.e. there was
    network-wide congruence between the within-species shared allelic distance
    of the parasitoid and that of its host). Narrowing of host-genotype-niche
    breadth by parasitoids could reduce resilience of the network to changes in
    host genetic structure or invasion by novel host genotypes and inhibit
    biological control. Thus, our approach can be easily used to detect changes
    to sub-species-level food webs, which may have important ecological and
    evolutionary implications, such as promoting host-race specialization or the
    accelerated loss of functional diversity following extinctions of closely
    related genotypes.

    Studies of complex networks show that nodes with high centrality scores are
    important to network structure and stability. Following this rationale,
    centrality measures can be used to (i) identify keystone species in
    ecological networks, a major issue in community ecology, and (ii)
    differentiate the keystone species concept, e.g. species may play a key role
    in a network for different topological reasons. In 34 pollination
    communities we examine the relationship between the generalization level of
    species (ND) and two complementary centrality indices: closeness (CC) and
    betweenness centrality (BC). CC measures the proximity of a species to all
    other species in the community, while BC describes the importance of a
    species as a connector. Most networks had a linear ND–CC relationship with a
    minimum CC value of 0.41. Hence, species were close to each and will be
    likely to be rapidly affected by disturbances. Contrarily, in most networks,
    the ND–BC relationships were power-law distributed with exponents larger
    than one. Only 59% of the species were connectors (BC > 0). In particular,
    there was a connector threshold value of ND = 0.46. Species above this
    threshold represent $40%, almost all of which were connectors. These results
    indicate that in pollination systems the most generalized species are
    usually network keystone species, playing at least two roles: (i) interact
    closely with most other species (high CC) and (ii) connect otherwise
    unconnected subnetworks (high BC). We discuss the implications of centrality
    measures to community-based conservation ecology.

    Complex networks of species interactions might be determined by species
    traits but also by simple chance meetings governed by species abundances.
    Although the idea that species traits structure mutualistic networks is
    appealing, most studies have found abundance to be a major structuring
    mechanism underlying interaction frequencies. With a well-resolved
    plant–hummingbird interaction network from the Neotropical savanna in
    Brazil, we asked whether species morphology, phenology, nectar availability
    and habitat occupancy and/or abundance best predicted the frequency of
    interactions. For this, we constructed interaction probability matrices and
    compared them to the observed plant-hummingbird matrix through a likelihood
    approach. Furthermore, a recently proposed modularity algorithm for weighted
    bipartite networks was employed to evaluate whether these factors also
    scale-up to the formation of modules in the network. Interaction frequencies
    were best predicted by species morphology, phenology and habitat occupancy,
    while species abundances and nectar availability performed poorly. The
    plant–hummingbird network was modular, and modules were associated to
    morphological specialization and habitat occupancy. Our ﬁndings highlight
    the importance of traits as determinants of interaction frequencies and
    network structure, corroborating the results of a previous study on a
    plant–hummingbird network from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Thus, we
    propose that traits matter more in tropical plant–hummingbird networks than
    in less specialized systems. To test the generality of this hypothesis,
    future research could employ geographic or taxonomic cross-system
    comparisons contrasting networks with known differences in level of
    specialization.

    Nature is organized into complex, dynamical networks of species and their
    interactions, which may influence diversity and stability. However, network
    research is, generally, short-term and depict ecological networks as static
    structures only, devoid of any dynamics. This hampers our understanding of
    how nature responds to larger disturbances such as changes in climate. In
    order to remedy this we studied the long-term (12-yrs) dynamics of a
    flower-visitation network, consisting of flower-visiting butterflies and
    their nectar plants. Global network properties, i.e. numbers of species and
    links, as well as connectance, were temporally stable, whereas most species
    and links showed a strong temporal dynamics. However, species of butterflies
    and plants varied bimodally in their temporal persistance: Sporadic species,
    being present only 1–2(-5) years, and stable species, being present
    (9-)11–12 years, dominated the networks. Temporal persistence and linkage
    level of species, i.e. number of links to other species, made up two groups
    of species: Specialists with a highly variable temporal persistence, and
    temporally stable species with a highly variable linkage level. Turnover of
    links of specialists was driven by species turnover, whereas turnover of
    links among generalists took place through rewiring, i.e. by reshuffling
    existing interactions. However, in spite of this strong internal dynamics of
    species and links the network appeared overall stable. If this global
    stability-local instability phenomenon is general, it is a most astonishing
    feature of ecological networks.

    Despite a strong current interest in ecological networks, the bulk of
    studies are static descriptions of the structure of networks, and very few
    analyze their temporal dynamics. Yet, understanding network dynamics is
    important in order to relate network patterns to ecological processes. We
    studied the day-to-day dynamics of an arctic pollination interaction network
    over two consecutive seasons. First, we found that new species entering the
    network tend to interact with already well-connected species, although there
    are deviations from this trend due, for example, to morphological
    mismatching between plant and pollinator traits and nonoverlapping
    phenophases of plant and pollinator species. Thus, temporal dynamics
    provides a mechanistic explanation for previously reported network patterns
    such as the heterogeneous distribution of number of interactions across
    species. Second, we looked for the ecological properties most likely to be
    mediating this dynamical process and found that both abundance and
    phenophase length were important determinants of the number of links per
    species.

    Statistical modelling of species presence/absence data in relation to mapped
    environmental predictors has been widely used to predict distributions of
    species for use in regional conservation planning. This paper evaluates the
    extent to which predictive mapping of habitat suitability might be re®ned by
    modelling relative abundance or density of a species instead of
    presence/absence. We use data collected at ®eld survey sites in north-east
    New South Wales to develop models predicting the abundance of vascular plant
    and vertebrate fauna species as a function of regional-scale environmental
    variables. The predictive accuracy of these models is then evaluated using
    survey data collected at independent evaluation sites. A number of `direct'
    abundance modelling techniques were evaluated including generalised linear
    and generalised additive Poisson regression, and zero-in¯ated negative
    binomial regression. We also evaluated the performance of predicted
    probability of occurrence generated by logistic regression modelling as an
    `indirect' index of abundance. Both the direct and indirect modelling
    techniques generally failed to provide consistently reliable predictions of
    abundance. Reasonably accurate models were produced for only 12 of the 44
    species evaluated. A further key ®nding was that, for all 12 of these
    species, predictions from direct abundance models performed no better as a
    relative index of abundance than predicted probabilities of occurrence
    generated by logistic regression modelling. Implications of these results
    for the use of predictive modelling in regional conservation planning are
    discussed. # 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

    Changes in the distribution of rainfall and the occurrence of extreme rain
    events will alter the size and persistence of aquatic ecosystems. Such
    alterations may affect the structure of local aquatic communities in terms
    of species composition, and by altering species interactions. In many
    aquatic ecosystems, leaf litter sustains detrital food webs and could
    regulate the responses of communities to changes in rainfall. Few empirical
    studies have focused on how rainfall changes will affect aquatic communities
    and none have evaluated if basal resource diversity can increase resistance
    to such rainfall effects. In this study, we used water-­holding terrestrial
    bromeliads, a tropical aquatic ecosystem, to test how predicted rainfall
    changes and litter diversity may affect community composition and trophic
    interactions. We used structural equation modeling to investigate the
    combined effects of rainfall changes and litter diversity on trophic
    interactions. We demonstrated that changes in rainfall disrupted trophic
    relationships, even though there were only minor direct effects on species
    abundance, richness, and community composition. Litter diversity was not
    able to reduce the impact of changes in rainfall on trophic interactions. We
    suggest that changes in rainfall can alter the way in which species
    ­interact with each other, decreasing the linkages among trophic groups.
    Such reductions in biotic interactions under climate change will have
    critical consequences for the functioning of tropical aquatic ecosystems.

    Species and interactions are being lost at alarming rates and it is
    imperative to understand how communities assemble if we have to prevent
    their collapse and restore lost interactions. Using an 8-year dataset
    comprising nearly 20 000 pollinator visitation records, we explore the
    assembly of plant–pollinator communities at native plant restoration sites
    in an agricultural landscape. We ﬁnd that species occupy highly dynamic
    network positions through time, causing the assembly process to be
    punctuated by major network reorganisations. The most persistent pollinator
    species are also the most variable in their network positions, contrary to
    what preferential attachment –the most widely studied theory of ecological
    network assembly – predicts. Instead, we suggest assembly occurs via an
    opportunistic attachment process. Our results contribute to our
    understanding of how communities assembly and how species interactions
    change through time while helping to inform efforts to reassemble robust
    communities.

    We propose an algorithm that generalizes to discrete data any given
    covariance modeling algorithm originally intended for Gaussian responses,
    via a Gaussian copula approach. Covariance modeling is a powerful tool for
    extracting meaning from multivariate data, and fast algorithms for Gaussian
    data, such as factor analysis and Gaussian graphical models, are widely
    available. Our algorithm makes these tools generally available to analysts
    of discrete data and can combine any likelihood-based covariance modeling
    method for Gaussian data with any set of discrete marginal distributions.
    Previously, tools for discrete data were generally specific to one family of
    distributions or covariance modeling paradigm, or otherwise did not exist.
    Our algorithm is more flexible than alternate methods, takes advantage of
    existing fast algorithms for Gaussian data, and simulations suggest that it
    outperforms competing graphical modeling and factor analysis procedures for
    count and binomial data. We additionally show that in a Gaussian copula
    graphical model with discrete margins, conditional independence
    relationships in the latent Gaussian variables are inherited by the discrete
    observations. Our method is illustrated with a graphical model and factor
    analysis on an overdispersed ecological count dataset of species abundances.

    Seasonal variation in the availability of floral hosts or pollinators is a
    key factor influencing diversity in plant-pollinator communities. In
    seasonally dry Neotropical habitats, where month-long periods of extreme
    drought are followed by a long rainy season, flowering is often synchronized
    with the beginning of precipitation, when environmental conditions are most
    beneficial for plant reproduction. In the Brazilian Cerrado, a seasonally
    dry ecosystem considered one of the world’s biodiversity hotspots for
    angiosperms, plants with shallow root systems flower predominantly during
    the rainy season. Foraging activity in social bees however, the major
    pollinators in this biome, is not restricted to any particular season
    because a constant supply of resources is necessary to sustain their
    perennial colonies. Despite the Cerrado’s importance as a center of plant
    diversity, the influence of its extreme cycles of drought and precipitation
    on the dynamics and stability of plant-pollinator communities is not well
    understood. We sampled plant-pollinator interactions of a Cerrado community
    weekly for one year and used network analyses to characterize intra-annual
    seasonal variation in community structure. We also compared seasonal
    differences in community robustness to species loss by simulating
    extinctions of plants and pollinators. We find that the community shrinks
    significantly in size during the dry season, becoming more vulnerable to
    disturbance due to the smaller pool of floral hosts available to pollinators
    during this period. Major changes in plant species composition but not in
    pollinators has led to high levels of turnover in plant-pollinator
    associations across seasons, indicated by in interaction dissimilarity (<3%
    of shared interactions). Aseasonal pollinators, which mainly include social
    bees and some solitary specialized bees, functioned as keystone species,
    maintaining robustness during periods of drastic changes in climatic
    conditions.

  abstract: >-
    Species-rich tropical communities are expected to be more specialized than
    their temperate counterparts [1–3]. Several studies have reported increasing
    biotic specialization toward the tropics [4–7], whereas others have not
    found latitudinal trends once accounting for sampling bias [8, 9] or
    differences in plant diversity [10, 11]. Thus, the direction of the
    latitudinal specialization gradient remains contentious. With an
    unprecedented global data set, we investigated how biotic specialization
    between plants and animal pollinators or seed dispersers is associated with
    latitude, past and contemporary climate, and plant diversity. We show that
    in contrast to expectation, biotic specialization of mutualistic networks is
    signiﬁcantly lower at tropical than at temperate latitudes. Specialization
    was more closely related to contemporary climate than to past climate
    stability, suggesting that current conditions have a stronger effect on
    biotic specialization than historical community stability. Biotic
    specialization decreased with increasing local and regional plant diversity.
    This suggests that high specialization of mutualistic interactions is a
    response of pollinators and seed dispersers to low plant diversity. This
    could explain why the latitudinal specialization gradient is reversed
    relative to the latitudinal diversity gradient. Low mutualistic network
    specialization in the tropics suggests higher tolerance against extinctions
    in tropical than in temperate communities.

    In the recent past, availability of large data sets of species presences has
    increased by orders of magnitude. This, together with developments in
    geographical information systems and statistical methods, has enabled
    scientists to calculate, for thousands of species, the environmental
    conditions of their distributional areas. The proﬁles thus obtained are
    obviously related to niche concepts in the Grinnell tradition, and separated
    from those in EltonÕs tradition. I argue that it is useful to deﬁne
    Grinnellian and Eltonian niches on the basis of the types of variables used
    to calculate them, the natural spatial scale at which they can be measured,
    and the dispersal of the individuals over the environment. I use set theory
    notation and analogies derived from population ecology theory to obtain
    formal deﬁnitions of areas of distribution and several types of niches. This
    brings clarity to several practical and fundamental questions in
    macroecology and biogeography.

    Macroecological models for predicting species distributions usually only
    include abiotic environmental conditions as explanatory variables, despite
    knowledge from community ecology that all species are linked to other
    species through biotic interactions. This disconnect is largely due to the
    different spatial scales considered by the two sub-disciplines:
    macroecologists study patterns at large extents and coarse resolutions,
    while community ecologists focus on small extents and ﬁne resolutions. A
    general framework for including biotic interactions in macroecological
    models would help bridge this divide, as it would allow for rigorous testing
    of the role that biotic interactions play in determining species ranges.
    Here, we present an approach that combines species distribution models with
    Bayesian networks, which enables the direct and indirect effects of biotic
    interactions to be modelled as propagating conditional dependencies among
    species’ presences. We show that including biotic interactions in
    distribution models for species from a California grassland community
    results in better range predictions across the western USA. This new
    approach will be important for improving estimates of species distributions
    and their dynamics under environmental change.

    Aim: Identifying suitable areas for invasive species establishment is of
    critical importance for their early detection and rapid eradication.
    However, our ability to detect suitable areas is impeded by the tendency of
    species to shift their niche postinvasion. In this study, we (a) investigate
    the frequency of niche shift within invasive freshwater invertebrates and
    (b) use niche conservatism information to prioritize potential hotspots of
    invasion for non-n­ ative freshwater invertebrates in New Zealand.

    Information about the relative importance of competitive or facilitative
    pollinator-mediated interactions in a multi-species context is limited. We
    studied interspeciﬁc pollen transfer (IPT) networks to evaluate quantity and
    quality effects of pollinator sharing among plant species on three
    high-Andean communities at 1600, 1800 and 2000 m a.s.l. To estimate the sign
    of the effects (positive, neutral or negative), the relation between
    conspeciﬁc and heterospeciﬁc pollen deposited on stigmas was analysed with
    GLMMs. Network analyses showed that communities were characterised by the
    presence of pollen hub-donors and receptors. We inferred that facilitative
    and neutral pollinator-mediated interactions among plants prevailed over
    competition. Thus, the beneﬁts from pollinator sharing seem to outweigh the
    costs (i.e. heterospeciﬁc deposition and conspeciﬁc pollen loss). The
    largest proportion of facilitated species was found at the highest elevation
    community, suggesting that under unfavourable conditions for the pollination
    service and at lower plant densities facilitation can be more common.

    Ecological networks have a long history in ecology, and a recent increase in
    network analyses across environmental gradients has revealed important
    changes in their structure, dynamics, and functioning. These changes can be
    broadly grouped according to three nonexclusive mechanisms: (a) changes in
    the species composition of the networks (driven by interaction patterns of
    invaders, nonrandom extinction of species according to their traits, or
    differences among species in population responses across gradients); (b)
    changes that alter interaction frequencies via changes in search efﬁciency
    (driven by altered habitat structure or metabolic rates) or changes in
    spatial and temporal overlap; and (c) changes to coevolutionary processes
    and patterns. Taking spatial and temporal processes into account can further
    elucidate network variation and improve predictions of network responses to
    environmental change. Emerging evidence links network structure to ecosystem
    functioning; however, scaling up to metanetworks or multilayer networks may
    modify interpretations of network structure, stability, and functioning.

    The main drivers of global environmental change (CO2 enrichment, nitrogen
    deposition, climate, biotic invasions and land use) cause extinctions and
    alter species distributions, and recent evidence shows that they exert
    pervasive impacts on various antagonistic and mutualistic interactions among
    species. In this review, we synthesize data from 688 published studies to
    show that these drivers often alter competitive interactions among plants
    and animals, exert multitrophic effects on the decomposer food web, increase
    intensity of pathogen infection, weaken mutualisms involving plants, and
    enhance herbivory while having variable effects on predation. A recurrent
    ﬁnding is that there is substantial variability among studies in both the
    magnitude and direction of effects of any given GEC driver on any given type
    of biotic interaction. Further, we show that higher order effects among
    multiple drivers acting simultaneously create challenges in predicting
    future responses to global environmental change, and that extrapolating
    these complex impacts across entire networks of species interactions yields
    unanticipated effects on ecosystems. Finally, we conclude that in order to
    reliably predict the effects of GEC on community and ecosystem processes,
    the greatest single challenge will be to determine how biotic and abiotic
    context alters the direction and magnitude of GEC effects on biotic
    interactions.

    The structure of mutualistic networks is likely to result from the
    simultaneous inﬂuence of neutrality and the constraints imposed by
    complementarity in species phenotypes, phenologies, spatial distributions,
    phylogenetic relationships, and sampling artifacts. We develop a conceptual
    and methodological framework to evaluate the relative contributions of these
    potential determinants. Applying this approach to the analysis of a
    plant–pollinator network, we show that information on relative abundance and
    phenology sufﬁces to predict several aggregate network properties
    (connectance, nestedness, interaction evenness, and interaction asymmetry).
    However, such information falls short of predicting the detailed network
    structure (the frequency of pairwise interactions), leaving a large amount
    of variation unexplained. Taken together, our results suggest that both
    relative species abundance and complementarity in spatiotemporal
    distribution contribute substantially to generate observed network patters,
    but that this information is by no means sufﬁcient to predict the occurrence
    and frequency of pairwise interactions. Future studies could use our
    methodological framework to evaluate the generality of our ﬁndings in a
    representative sample of study systems with contrasting ecological
    conditions.

  abstract: >-
    Predictions on the consequences of the rapidly increasing atmospheric CO2
    levels and associated climate warming for population dynamics, ecological
    community structure and ecosystem functioning depend on mechanistic
    energetic models of temperature effects on populations and their
    interactions. However, such mechanistic approaches combining warming effects
    on metabolic (energy loss of organisms) and feeding rates (energy gain by
    organisms) remain a key, yet elusive, goal. Aiming to ﬁll this void, we
    studied the metabolic rates and functional responses of three differently
    sized, predatory ground beetles on one mobile and one more resident prey
    species across a temperature gradient (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 1C).
    Synthesizing metabolic and functional-response theory, we develop novel
    mechanistic predictions how predator–prey interaction strengths (i.e.,
    functional responses) should respond to warming. Corroborating prior theory,
    warming caused strong increases in metabolism and decreases in handling
    time. Consistent with our novel model, we found increases in predator attack
    rates on a mobile prey, whereas attack rates on a mostly resident prey
    remained constant across the temperature gradient. Together, these results
    provide critically important information that environmental warming
    generally increases the direct short-term per capita interaction strengths
    between predators and their prey as described by functional-response models.
    Nevertheless, the several fold stronger increase in metabolism with warming
    caused decreases in energetic efﬁciencies (ratio of per capita feeding rate
    to metabolic rate) for all predator–prey interactions. This implies that
    warming of natural ecosystems may dampen predator–prey oscillations thus
    stabilizing their dynamics. The severe long-term implications; however,
    include predator starvation due to energetic inefﬁciency despite abundant
    resources.
