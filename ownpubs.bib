  abstract = {That evolutionary history can influence the way that species interact is a basic tenet of evolutionary ecology. However, when the role of evolution in determining ecological interactions is investigated, focus typically centers on just one side of the interaction. A cophylogenetic signal, the congruence of evolutionary history across both sides of an ecological interaction, extends these previous explorations and provides a more complete picture of how evolutionary patterns influence the way species interact. To date, cophylogenetic signal has most typically been studied in interactions that occur between fine taxonomic clades that show high intimacy. In this study, we took an alternative approach and made an exhaustive assessment of cophylogeny in pollination interactions. To do so, we assessed the strength of cophylogenetic signal at four distinct scales of pollination interaction: (1) across plant–pollinator associations globally, (2) in local pollination communities, (3) within the modular structure of those communities, and (4) in individual modules. We did so using a globally distributed dataset comprised of 54 pollination networks, over 4000 species, and over 12,000 interactions. Within these data, we detected cophylogenetic signal at all four scales. Cophylogenetic signal was found at the level of plant–pollinator interactions on a global scale and in the majority of pollination communities. At the scale defined by the modular structure within those communities, however, we observed a much weaker cophylogenetic signal. Cophylogenetic signal was detectable in a significant proportion of individual modules and most typically when withinmodule phylogenetic diversity was low. In sum, the detection of cophylogenetic signal in pollination interactions across scales provides a new dimension to the story of how past evolution shapes extant pollinator–angiosperm interactions.},

  abstract = {Many different concepts have been used to describe species’ roles in food webs (i.e., the ways in which species participate in their communities as consumers and resources). As each concept focuses on a different aspect of food-web structure, it can be diﬃcult to relate these concepts to each other and to other aspects of ecology. Here we use the Eltonian niche as an overarching framework, within which we summarize several commonly-used role concepts (degree, trophic level, motif roles, and centrality). We focus mainly on the topological versions of these concepts but, where dynamical versions of a role concept exist, we acknowledge these as well. Our aim is to highlight areas of overlap and ambiguity between different role concepts and to describe how these roles can be used to group species according to different strategies (i.e., equivalence and functional roles). The existence of “gray areas” between role concepts make it essential for authors to carefully consider both which role concept(s) are most appropriate for the analyses they wish to conduct and what aspect of species’ niches (if any) they wish to address. The ecological meaning of differences between species’ roles can change dramatically depending on which role concept(s) are used.},

  abstract = {Understanding variations in habitat use through time contributes to identification of habitats critical for species survival. Here we used passive acoustic telemetry to examine the residency and site fidelity patterns of the reef manta ray Mobula alfredi at Lady Elliot Island (LEI), a key aggregation site in eastern Australia. Six acoustic receivers were moored around LEI between 2009 and 2012, and 34 acoustic transmitters were deployed on manta rays. All tagged animals returned to this site within their recording period, with some individuals visiting the area for up to 23 consecutive days. Using a set of mixed effect models, we analysed the hourly visitation patterns of manta rays in relation to temporal and environmental variables. Diel phase and sea temperature showed the strongest effects on the presence of manta rays, with weaker effects detected for wind direction, wind speed and moon illumination. Individuals occupied LEI habitat mostly during daylight hours and in calm weather conditions, which may be linked with behavioural thermoregulation, social interactions and cleaning activities. Their absence at night may be related to foraging strategies in deeper offshore waters. The effect of sea temperature reflects the greater seasonal occurrence of manta rays at LEI in winter, when temperatures are coolest, potentially in response to regional food availability. The high degree of manta ray site fidelity at aggregation sites underscores the importance of these areas as key daytime habitats for the species. We suggest that conservation measures should prioritise the protection of coastal aggregation habitats from overexploitation and degradation.},
