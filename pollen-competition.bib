  abstract = {Species roles in ecological networks combine to generate their architecture, which contributes to their stability. Species trait diversity also affects ecosystem functioning and resilience, yet it remains unknown whether species’ contributions to functional diversity relate to their network roles. Here, we use 21 empirical pollen transport networks to characterise this relationship. We found that, apart from a few abundant species, pollinators with original traits either had few interaction partners or interacted most frequently with a subset of these partners. This suggests that narrowing of interactions to a subset of the plant community accompanies pollinator niche specialisation, congruent with our hypothesised trade-off between having unique traits vs. being able to interact with many mutualist partners. Conversely, these effects were not detected in plants, potentially because key aspects of their ﬂowering traits are conserved at a family level. Relating functional and network roles can provide further insight into mechanisms underlying ecosystem functioning.},

  abstract = {Land use intensiﬁcation reduces natural areas and alters landscape heterogeneity diminishing species richness and changing ecosystem functionality. The analysis of interaction networks is a useful tool for estimating the degree of change experienced by ecosystems. Here, plant–ﬂoral visitor networks from fragments of grassland restored by agricultural activities discontinued over a long time were compared with networks from agriculturalized fragments nearby. The hypothesis evaluated was that land use intensiﬁcation changes the structure of the original networks by modifying species richness and the network degree of specialization. The study was carried out at three sites located over a 700 km transect across the provinces of Buenos Aires and La Pampa, Argentina. At each site, four fragments were selected (two restored and two agricultural). Five monthly samplings were taken between November and March along three consecutive years. Entomophilous plants and their ﬂoral visitors were identiﬁed and all plant–ﬂoral visitor interactions were recorded. With these data, richness of plants and visitors were calculated, interaction networks were constructed and the degree of specialization was calculated for each network. Land use intensiﬁcation caused changes in the community composition and degree of specialization. When cropping was the predominant farming enterprise, richness of ﬂoral visitors and plants decreased as compared to restored fragments. When cattle production was the predominant land use, richness of ﬂoral visitors remained stable. However, at one of the sites plants richness was 48\% higher in the grazed fragments than in those restored. In the agricultural fragments, the abundance of units of ﬂoral attraction due to exotic plants increased, but the visitation rates were the same as in the restored fragments. The networks in the agricultural fragments were more generalist than in restored fragments, in agreement with previous studies on the effect of land use intensiﬁcation on natural systems.},

  abstract = {Agricultural land management modiﬁes ecosystem structure and functioning in natural landscapes. Pollinators are a key functional group that may suffer from such intensiﬁcation. Here we evaluate how agricultural land management inﬂuences the diversity of pollen transported by pollinators and the pollination niche overlap among plants. We described pollen transport networks (which allow assessing the contribution of pollinators to the ﬂow of pollen among plants) in agricultural and restored fragments in three sites representative of the pampas region of Argentina. We analyzed diversity of pollen transported by pollinators and the pollination niche overlap among plants in both types of fragments with general and generalized linear mixed models. The agricultural fragments were associated to increased diversity of transported pollen and pollination niche overlap among plants. Greater pollination niche overlap in agricultural fragments was associated with increased abundance of exotic plants. Our results indicate that agricultural intensiﬁcation has signiﬁcantly increased the diversity of pollen and the pollination niche overlap in natural communities by promoting exotic plants and generalized plantpollinator interactions. Strategies to encourage improvements in the quality of pollination in agroecosystems could range from controlling the levels of exotic species to mechanisms that promote increased diversity of native plants.},

Both the quantity (number of conspeciﬁc pollen grains deposited on stigmas) and quality (proportion of heterospeciﬁc pollen grains deposited on stigmas) of the pollination service was estimated for three to nine entomophilous plants in each landscape fragment.

These plant-pollinator webs can be studied in the manner of conventional food webs and the aim of this paper is to illustrate how contemporary methods of web construction and analysis can be applied to plant-pollinator communities.},

  abstract = {Pollination network studies are based on pollinator surveys conducted on focal plants. This plant-centred approach provides insufﬁcient information on ﬂower visitation habits of rare pollinator species, which are the majority in pollinator communities. As a result, pollination networks contain very high proportions of pollinator species linked to a single plant species (extreme specialists), a pattern that contrasts with the widely accepted view that plant–pollinator interactions are mostly generalized. In this study of a Mediterranean scrubland community in NE Spain we supplement data from an intensive ﬁeld survey with the analysis of pollen loads carried by pollinators. We observed 4265 contacts corresponding to 19 plant and 122 pollinator species. The addition of pollen data unveiled a very signiﬁcant number of interactions, resulting in important network structural changes. Connectance increased 1.43-fold, mean plant connectivity went from 18.5 to 26.4, and mean pollinator connectivity from 2.9 to 4.1. Extreme specialist pollinator species decreased 0.6-fold, suggesting that ecological specialization is often overestimated in plant–pollinator networks. We expected a greater connectivity increase in rare species, and consequently a decrease in the level of asymmetric specialization. However, new links preferentially attached to already highly connected nodes and, as a result, both nestedness and centralization increased. The addition of pollen data revealed the existence of four clearly deﬁned modules that were not apparent when only ﬁeld survey data were used. Three of these modules had a strong phenological component. In comparison to other pollination webs, our network had a high proportion of connector links and species. That is, although signiﬁcant, the four modules were far from isolated.},

  abstract = {Pollinator unpredictability favors evolutionary shifts from outcrossing to autonomous selﬁng, which provides reproductive assurance. Our goal was to quantify the reproductive assurance beneﬁt of autonomous selﬁng and the stochastic nature of pollinatormediated pollen receipt using three wild populations of the annual species Collinsia verna (Scrophulariaceae) over three years. The timing of autonomous self-pollination in C. verna ranges from competing to delayed, with more than half of the autonomous pollen arriving late in ﬂoral life. Floral density, identity of insect ﬂoral visitors, and visitation rate varied within and among years, with signiﬁcant variation in pollinator community between years within populations. Pollinator failure reduced fruit set within and among populations across years. However, reproductive assurance selﬁng increased fruit set on average by 8\% overall and up to 30\% in one population. Despite this ﬁtness beneﬁt, fruit set (ϭ⌺fruits/⌺ﬂowers) estimated in pollinator-exclusion cages was signiﬁcantly less than the fruit set in paired open-pollinated plots. In a series of experiments, we found no difference in fruit set from self- vs. outcross pollen, ruling out early inbreeding depression. However, ﬂowers, handoutcrossed at the same time that autonomous selﬁng naturally occurs, produced signiﬁcantly more fruits relative to ﬂowers that received pollen only through autonomous selﬁng. These results suggest that pollen type (self/outcross) is less important to fruiting success than is the timing or efﬁciency of autonomous pollination relative to vector-mediated pollination. Our results support the reproductive assurance hypothesis and suggest that autonomous selﬁng in C. verna is adaptive under variable pollinator conditions. Fruit set results from both pollinator-delivered and autonomous self-pollen, suggesting a ‘‘best of both worlds’’ scenario, with mixed mating a likely outcome.},

  abstract = {Decades of research have demonstrated that many calcifying species are negatively affected by ocean acidification, a major anthropogenic threat in marine ecosystems. However, even closely related species may exhibit different responses to ocean acidification and less is known about the drivers that shape such variation in different species. Here, we examine the drivers of physiological performance under ocean acidification in a group of five species of turf‐forming coralline algae. Specifically, quantitating the relative weight of evidence for each of ten hypotheses, we show that variation in coralline calcification and photosynthesis was best explained by allometric traits. Across ocean acidification conditions, larger individuals (measured as noncalcified mass) had higher net calcification and photosynthesis rates. Importantly, our approach was able to not only identify the aspect of size that drove the performance of coralline algae, but also determined that responses to ocean acidification were not dependent on species identity, evolutionary relatedness, habitat, shape, or structural composition. In fact, we found that failure to test multiple, alternative hypotheses would underestimate the generality of physiological performances, leading to the conclusion that each species had different baseline performance under ocean acidification. Testing among alternative hypotheses is an essential step toward determining the generalizability of experiments across taxa and identifying common drivers of species responses to global change.},

These mutualistic interactions often involve dozens or even hundreds of species that form complex networks of interdependences. Understanding how coevolution proceeds in these highly diversiﬁed mutualisms among freeliving species presents a conceptual challenge. Recent work has led to the unambiguous conclusion that mutualistic networks are very heterogeneous (the bulk of the species have a few interactions, but a few species are much more connected than expected by chance), nested (specialists interact with subsets of the species with which generalists interact), and built on weak and asymmetric links among species. Both ecological variables (e.g., phenology, local abundance, and geographic range) and past evolutionary history may explain such network patterns. Network structure has important implications for the coexistence and stability of species as well as for the coevolutionary process. Mutualistic networks can thus be regarded as the architecture of biodiversity.},
