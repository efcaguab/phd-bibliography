  abstract = {Hummingbirds and their floral resources in a forest fragment in Vi{\c c}osa, southeastern Brazil. Between August 1998 and August 1999, hummingbirds and plant species used by an them as nectar sources were recorded in the Mata do Para{\'i}so forest reserve. This area is a regeneration of Atlantic Forest with an area of 194.36 ha. It is located in the municipality of Vi{\c c}osa, in the Forest Zone of Minas Gerais. Fourteen plant species were visited by the hummingbirds as floral resources, 11 of them ornitophilous and three entomophilous. Most of the plant species occures in the understore or in the forest edges, presenting herbaceous or creeper habitus and bloom in during the rainy season. During the dry season, Geissomeria schottiana and Ruellia brevifolia seemed to be the main nectar sources for the hummingbirds. In five ornitophilous species of Acanthaceae, we recorded six of the eight hummingbird species, confirming the importance of this family for the maintenance of hummingbirds in the reserve. Phaethornis ruber was the most common hummingbird observed (it visited flowers of 10 species), followed by P. squalidus (nine species) and Thalurania glaucopis (four species). Males of T. glaucopis displayed territorial behavior when visiting flowers of G. schottiana and Mendoncia velloziana.},

  abstract = {The structural organization of mutualism networks, typified by interspecific positive interactions, is important to maintain community diversity. However, there is little information available about the effect of introduced species on the structure of such networks. We compared uninvaded and invaded ecological communities, to examine how two species of invasive plants with large and showy flowers (Carpobrotus affine acinaciformis and Opuntia stricta) affect the structure of Mediterranean plant-pollinator networks. To attribute differences in pollination to the direct presence of the invasive species, areas were surveyed that contained similar native plant species cover, diversity and floral composition, with or without the invaders. Both invasive plant species received significantly more pollinator visits than any native species and invaders interacted strongly with pollinators. Overall, the pollinator community richness was similar in invaded and uninvaded plots, and only a few generalist pollinators visited invasive species exclusively. Invasive plants acted as pollination super generalists. The two species studied were visited by 43\% and 31\% of the total insect taxa in the community, respectively, suggesting they play a central role in the plant-pollinator networks. Carpobrotus and Opuntia had contrasting effects on pollinator visitation rates to native plants: Carpobrotus facilitated the visit of pollinators to native species, whereas Opuntia competed for pollinators with native species, increasing the nestedness of the plant-pollinator network. These results indicate that the introduction of a new species to a community can have important consequences for the structure of the plant-pollinator network.},

Cluster analysis separated 49 plant families into five groups: 13 families were mainly visited by Hymenoptera, 17 by Diptera, five by Coleoptera and two by Hemiptera. The other 12 families were visited by various insect groups. Flowers visited by hymenopterans were further separated into plant families mainly visited by Bombinae, Xylocopinae, Halictidae, Apinae, Xylocopinae, Megachilidae, Vespoidea, Ichneumonoidea and others. Flower preference was compared among insect orders and among families, Themostpreferred plant family was Saxifragaceae in Lepidoptera, Coleoptera and Hymenoptera,Labiatae in Hemiptera and Umbelliferae in Diptera. Flower preference greatly varied among families in Apoidea.

  abstract = {Amami Islands, located in the northern part of the Ryukyu Archipelago, are endowed with subtropical climate and rich flora and fauna containing many endemic taxa. In various types of vegetation on the islands, such as Castanopsis-dominated lowland forests, Symplocos-dominated mountain forests, mangrove forests, coastal scrub and grassland, I surveyed the flowering phenology and anthophilous insect communities of 164 plant species from 1996 to 1999. Flowering was observed throughout the year, and peaked twice in March and July. A total of 2210 individuals of 610 species in 12 orders of Insecta were observed on the flowers. The most abundant order was Diptera (32SO)6o of individuals), followed by Coleoptera (28906o), Hymenoptera (23SO)6e), Hemiptera (1 1 906o), Lepidoptera (4SO)6o). The bee fauna was composed of six families, 13 genera and 26 species, and characterized by dominance of small bees (e,g., Hylaeus, Lasioglossum and Andrena), large carpenter bees (Xylocopa) and long-tongued anthophorine bees (Tetralonia and Amegt'lla), and by absence of Bombus. The bee community contrasted with both the honeybee/stingless bee-dominated community in the Asian Tropics and the bumblebee-dominated community at temperate habitats. The rarity of social-bees is thought to result from seasonal and annual/supra-annual variability in floral resource on the islands. I inferred the pollinators of each plant species by examining flower-visitor communities, visitor behavior, pollen attachment on visitor's body and floral morphology. Among 104 plant species examined, the most dominant pollination type was melittophily (61\%), followed by myiophily (13906), unspecialized entomophily (9.6SO)6o), anemophily (6.7906), butterfly/hawkmoth-pollination (6.7SO)6) and cantharophily (2.9\%o). Among melittophilous species, small-bee-pollinated species (370/o) were most dominant, followed by XylocoPa-(21SO\vphantom\{\}6o), Tetralonia-(17906), megachilid-(9.5SO)6), Amegilla-(7.9SO)6) and Colletes /APis-(6.39(of) and wasp-pollinated (1.6 9(of) species. The high proportions of those plants pollinated by long-tongued solitary bees (55.4SO\vphantom\{\}6) contrasted with the high proportions of bumblebee-po]linated flowers on the mainland of Japan.},

  abstract = {In pollination mutualisms, new resource patches are constantly being created as new flowering species come into bloom. These patch dynamics can have effects on the organization of multispecies pollination guilds, depending on the temporal and spatial variation of floral resources. The goal of this work was to investigate the temporal dynamics of the flower use by a hummingbird community in a highland temperate forest in central Mexico. The system was studied in terms of the seasonal changes in (1) specific composition and abundance of hummingbirds and their plants, (2) use of floral resources, and (3) nectar characteristics of hummingbird-pollinated plants. Eight plant species were visited by hummingbirds. These species differed in nectar and sugar characteristics and flowering intensity throughout the year. The highest floral abundance was recorded from May to October. Three plant species showed blooming peaks in this period; these species, Salvia elegans, Bouvardia ternifolia, and Penstemon roseus, were the most abundant and most visited flowering species over the year. Eight species of hummingbirds were recorded: two resident hummingbirds, three altitudinal migrants, and three winter visitors. Hummingbirds showed seasonal preferences and changes in foraging behaviour with respect to visitation rates and the use of floral resources among habitats. This work suggests that the availability and quality of resources can explain the temporal and spatial composition of the hummingbird community on a local scale.},

  abstract = {We studied hummingbirds and their food plants in an area of caatinga vegetation. We specifically examined their seasonal use of this habitat, migratory and non-migratory status, their foraging strategies and community roles The study was conducted in an area of arboreal-shrub caatinga, located in the Serra do Par{\'a}, municipality of Santa Cruz do Capibaribe, state of Pernambuco in northeastern Brazil. Field work was undertaken during 12 expeditions on a monthly basis between June, 2007 and May, 2008. Five species of hummingbirds were recorded visiting flowers in the community studied. Three were considered residents: Chlorostilbon lucidus (Shaw, 1812), Eupetomena macroura (Gmelin, 1788), and Heliomaster squamosus (Temminck, 1823). Hummingbirds visited 31 species of plants, of which only five presented attributes related to ornithophily. C. lucidus visited 29 plant species, including all ornithophilous species, and it was the most aggressive, defending territories. Among hummingbirds, C. lucidus may be considered the principal pollinator. Hummingbirds may also be acting as pollen vectors for some of the plant species not identified as ornithophilous. The hummingbird guilds varied among the plant species used as floral resources, as well as in their frequency of visits. Differences in plant species abundance, hummingbird preference, competitive exclusion or flowering seasonality are factors likely to influence those variations.},

Of the insects collected, 77\% of all individuals and 77\% of all species belonged to Diptera. The ratio of pollinators to plant species was 1.5, which is lower than in other Arctic pollination networks. This might be a double-island effect as Uummannaq is a small island next to Greenland. Connectance was 14.3\%, and linkage level of pollinator and plant species averaged 2.4 and 3.7 species links, respectively. The characteristic path length and average clustering coefficient of the 1-mode networks were 1.4 and 0.83, respectively, for the pollinator species and 1.3 and 0.79, respectively, for the plant species. For both pollinator species and plant species, the tail of the degree distribution had the best fit to an exponential model, indicating that the most connected species was constrained in their linking. However, the extremely short path length and high clustering indicated that the networks had smallworld behavior, meaning that any disturbance is spread very fast to the entire network and that the networks are error tolerant but vulnerable to attack on the most linked species.},

In the low-altitude (montane) habitat, 23 plant species had a total of 126 interactions with 71 taxa of insects and one hummingbird, and at the higher site 21 plants and 45 insect species had 83 interactions. Connectances of the visitor matrices were 7.6 and 8.7, respectively. Diptera and Hymenoptera dominated the visitor assemblages at both sites without change of proportions with altitude, while Lepidoptera significantly increased at the higher site. Flies were more species-rich than expected at the sites' latitude and more constant across altitudes than is usually observed. Lack of a significant decrease with altitude of (1) the frequency of Hymenoptera and (2) the number of interactions per plant were the main differences with a comparable gradient in the Chilean Andes. The proportion of self-compatible species increased with altitude; however, use of phylogenetically-independent contrasts showed that the prevalence of selfers at higher altitudes does not reflect a generalized reaction pattern but results from two speciose families (Asteraceae and Fabaceae) showing more self-compatibility at high altitudes.},

  abstract = {Species flowering during the dry season (late December to early April) form three main pollinator groups, namely, butterfly, solitary bee, and hummingbird flowers. The animal vectors present match these three flower syndromes. The daily and seasonal rhythms of flower opening and pollination activity are synchronized. Butterflies and solitary bees, active chiefly in the morning, visit flowers blooming only half a day. The number of seeds per fruit and the pollencarrying capacity of the pollen vector are correlated. Butterflies, carrying few pollen grains, chiefly pollinate flowers with one to four seeds. Solitary bees, carrying many grains, chiefly pollinate flowers with many seeds per flower. These close links between the flowers and their visitors result in a high degree of successful pollination and a high percentage fruit set. A group of species, attracting no visitors, was characterized by a very narrow 'pollination gap,' making self-pollination almost inevitable. Heavy fruiting indicated self-fertility. Heterocorollary in Cordia sebestena, a double keel in Stylosanthes hamata, and several examples of andromonoecy are recorded for the first time. The presence of the adventive honeybee, Apis mellifera, in the association appeared detrimental to the native pollinators when forage was scarce. The whole scrub association appears balanced with a distinctive pattern of floral ecology. This circumstance, in terms of pollinators, is designated a Butterfly-Solitary bee-Hummingbird association.},

  abstract = {Island biogeography theory predicts that species richness increases with habitat area and declines with isolation. We expand this framework to address changes in the number of links and species in pollination webs from 12 isolated hills, ranging in area from tens to thousands of hectares, immersed in the agriculture matrix of the Argentine Pampas. We also studied whether total interaction frequency is partitioned more evenly among individual links in richer webs. Our results reveal a direct effect of area on the number of links and species present in each pollination web. However, link richness increased twofold faster than species richness with area. These area effects were not confounded by sampling effort or correlated incidence of exotic species, despite widespread habitat disturbance. Habitat proximity, an inverse measure of isolation, had a marginally significant influence on link but not on species richness. Increased link number was associated with decreasing dominance by any particular interaction and increasing interaction evenness. Despite the strong area effect, a rich pollination web sampled from a small, protected sierra suggests that simple conservation measures, such as reduced grazing and fire suppression, may effectively preserve much local interaction diversity.},

Floweringof all species typically occurredduringthe first prolongedperiodof weathersuitable for pollinatoractivityandceased by the timethe canopyclosed. Annualdifferencesin floweringtimes were associated with differences in average temperatures(i.e., early bloomingin a warm, early spring), but cumulative degree-hours or degree-days of air or soil temperatures were not well correlated with flowering times. Other constraints on flowering phenology are discussed, including the predictability of suitable conditions, a proposed "fail-safe" mechanism that may assure flowering beforecanopyclosureeven if temperaturesareabnormallylow, andthe importanceof nontemperature factors in definingsuitableconditions. Floweringtime was not very finely tunedto the temperature regimeand pollinatoractivity; flowers bloomingduringthe floweringpeak often had low seed productionand the fertilizationrate of most species was low.

Both the natura1 and semi-natura1 grasslands are inhabited by many grassland-specific plant species, some of which are now endangered in Japan. To understand pollination mutualisms in the grassland ecosystem, we investigated the flowering phenology and anthophilous insect communities on 149 plant species from 49 different plant families, from April to October 2001. In tota1, 1192 individuals from 308 species, 83 families and 10 orders of Insecta were observed on flowers of 101 plant species. The most abundant insect order was Hymenoptera (37.89o of individuals), followed by Diptera (32.59o), Coleoptera (22.79o) and Lepidoptera (6.29o), The proportions of Coleoptera and Lepidoptera were respectively smaller and greater than in forested habitats, suggesting that many anthophilous beetles depend on woody plants during their larval stages and that anthophilous butterflies (especially Nymphalidae) are associated with grassland-specific perennials (especially Viola spp.) in their larval stages. The bee fauna consisted of 54 species, from 1O genera and 6 families; the bee community was characterized by an absence of cavity-nesting Hylaeus and Xylocopa and by the predominance of long-tongued Tetratonia in the early spring. The bumblebee community was characterized by the predominance of a shorthaired Bombus ignitus, uncommon in forested habhats. The dominant pollination syndrome, among 70 plant species for which pollinators svere inferred, was melittophily (829o), followed by myophily (149o), psychophily (1.49o), phalaenophily (I.49o) and anemophily (1.49o). Among the melittophilous species, small-bee-pol]inated species (459o) dominated, followed by Bombus- (369o), Apis- (8.69o), Tetratonia- (6.99o), megachilid- (1.79o) and wasp- (1.79o) pollinated species. These data on community-level plant-pollinator interactions at Mt. Yufu will contribute to the conservation of endangered grassland ecosystems.},
